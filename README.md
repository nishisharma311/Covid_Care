# COVID Care
## Reimagining the health checkup procedures in post covid era

### Our Inspiration
As the world will reopen after the pandemic, there will be a necessity to follow the covid SOP in public places and the need for a one-stop solution for checking all the vitals will surge. Our project COVID CARE was made to serve this need.
It focuses on providing maximum services to track the health of a person and maintain a database of the health of people checking in a public place. 

### The problem it solves
1. Provides an instant report of a person's pulse rate, oxygen levels and body temperature.
2. Access your health records at a public check-in on the mobile app.
3. Maintains a database of the health of all the people checking in at a public place.
4. Sends alert in case of adverse changes in health parameters.
5.  The user of the mobile app can also add health records.

### Challenges we ran into
1.  Because we did simulation online we were not able to find the libraries of some sensors and hence, could not include them in our device.
2.  We faced difficulty in integrating Wi-fi functionality in our device because of absense of Proteus library.

### Technologies we used
`Arduino Uno`, `Proteus`,`I2C communication protocol`,`tmp36`,`Pulse Sensor`,`MIT App Inventor`
